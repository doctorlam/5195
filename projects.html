	  		<h3>Copyediting Midterm - 15%</h3>
	  		<h4>Description</h4>
	  			<p>You will be given 1 entire class period to complete a copyediting exam. The exam will cover all copyediting topics covered in class and in the readings. The items will include a mix of long technical passages and shorter sentence-level items.</p>

	  		<h4>Grading</h4>
